For the columns which are numeric we have the minimum and maximum values, 1st and 3rd quartile, median and mean. For columns with categorical data it will show the count for the first few rows and then a total for how many are in other categories. If there were any missing values in our dataset it would tell us that as well. For a quick overview of a single column of categorical data, we can use the table function.\n\nsummary(data)\n\ntable (data$type)\n\nIf you’re working with data that you’ve imported from a spreadsheet created in Excel, you’ll often find that people have included spaces or used capital letters in the column names. This is something that you can change manually, using the function rename(), which takes the order rename(new_name = old_name) For changing multiple columns, it’s much easier to use a function from the janitor package.\n\ndata &lt;- data |&gt;\n  rename(`Organisation Code` = org_code)\n\ndata &lt;- data |&gt;\n  rename(Breaches = breaches,\n         PERIOD = period,\n         ` type` = type)\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n# if this is not installed, install it manually\n\ndata &lt;- clean_names(data)\n\nThe Janitor package has other helpful functions, including to change the format of dates, remove empty rows, or find duplicate rows.

    "text": "Transcript and code\nWe’re going to start with recapping some base R and dplyr functions that you may have already come across. Dplyr is part of the tidyverse, so I’m loading that, and also the NHSRdatasets package, which includes the data we’re going to use. To run multiple lines of code in the source pane we can select the rows we want & press Ctrl + Enter.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(NHSRdatasets)\n\nNext we load some data for attendances at Accident & Emergency (A&E). To run a single line of code we can position the cursor anywhere in the line and use Ctrl + Enter.\n\ndata &lt;- ae_attendances\n\nIn the environment panel in the top right corner, by clicking the blue arrow we can see the structure of the dataframe – over 12,000 rows of 6 columns, and it tells us the data type of those columns. We can also click on the symbol on the right which opens the dataframe in a tab in the source pane. To get the names of the columns in a dataframe we can use either colnames() or names() function.\nSince we’re working with a dataframe, they both give the same output.\n\ncolnames(data)      # works on matrices and data frames\nnames(data)         # works on vectors and data frames\n\nUsing dataframe name $ column name will return the content of that column, but especially when it’s a long column, it can be more useful to just find the unique data items. Now we can see there are 274 unique entries in that column.\n\n# using $ sign to select a column\ndata$type\n\n# get list of unique data items in a variable\nunique(data$org_code)\n\nIf you know the position of a specific entry you want to retrieve, you can use square brackets. For a range of entries using the colon. *If you’re coming to R with a knowledge of python, note that R starts counting from 1, not zero.\n\n# we can select a specific entry within that vector with square brackets\n# to call the 4th entry we can use\ndata$type[4]\n\n# we could also call the 4th to 10th entries\ndata$type[4:10]\n\nrange() is a really useful function for working with numeric or character data, returning the maximum and minimum values.\n\n# get the range of a variable (useful for dates)\nrange(data$period)\n\nstr() function shows you the structure of the dataframe, the same as you can see in the environment, but returns it as an output down in the console.\n\n# see structure of data to check data types\nstr(data)\n\nThe head & tail functions allow you to see a snippet of the dataframe, by default head() returns the first 5 rows and tail() the last 5 rows. By adding a number after the data source we can change that and return however many rows we’d like to see.\n\n# see the first 5 rows of data\nhead(data)\n\n# see the last 5 rows of data\ntail(data)\n\n# see the first 15 rows of data\nhead(data, \n     15)\n\nDplyr has a group of similar functions called slice_. Not only can you get a number of rows, you can also choose a proportion. If you want to order the dataframe by a different column, you can add order_by = .\n\n# see the first 15 rows of data \ndplyr::slice_head(data, \n      n = 15)\n\n# see the first 15% of total rows of data \nslice_head(data,\n           prop = .15)\n\n# see the first 15% of total rows of data\n# ordered by attendances\nslice_max(data, \n         prop = .15, \n         order_by = attendances)\n\nThere’s lots more information on the various slice_ functions in the help file, which you can access using ?slice in the console pane.",
